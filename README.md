# Express Framework

[![wercker status](https://app.wercker.com/status/bb5c4deb25df9531aa699406b91c1fae/s/master "wercker status")](https://app.wercker.com/project/byKey/bb5c4deb25df9531aa699406b91c1fae)

Docker/Wercker based Express framework, using Dokku for deployment

## Local Development

### Prerequisites

You must have Docker and Wercker Cli installed before beginning.

### Getting Started

* Clone this repo
* cd into the root of the repo and run `tools/dev`

The application should now be running on port 80. You will be attached to the running container and the log viewer will run.

If you need to run adhoc commands, hit `ctrl+c` to exit the log viewer. You can return to the log viewer by simply running `log`

To exit fully from the container, hit `ctrl+c` to exit the log viewer and then type `exit` to exit the container.

### Environment

Any environment variables which need to be supplied when developing locally can be placed in the `ENVIRONMENT` file, with variable names prefixed with `X_`. For any variables which you don't want adding to the repository can be added to the `ENVIRONMENT_LOCAL.template` file, without the `X_` prefix. If this template file is not empty, the application will not start without an `ENVIRONMENT_LOCAL` file being created.

## Upgrading

### Docker base images

You should periodically update the node base image as new versions are released. To do so, update the node box in `wercker.yml` and the base image in `dokku/Dockerfile` for deployment.

## Deployment

The framework is setup to deploy to a Dokku instance using Wercker.

### Wercker Project Setup

1. Navigate to your project and open the `Workflows` tab
2. Click `Add new pipeline`
3. Fill in the form:
    - **Name** - [staging/production]
    - **YML Pipeline name** - deploy
    - **Hook type** - default
4. Click the `Create` button
5. On the resulting page, create a new SSH key by clicking the `Generate SSH Keys` link below and to the right of the Pipeline environment variables section:
    - **SSH key name** - DOKKU_KEY
6. Create three environment variables:
    - **DOKKU_HOST** - String - [your dokku host ip or fqdn]
    - **DOKKU_APP** - String - express
7. Go back to the `Workflows` tab
8. click the `+ icon` next the the `build` workflow.
9. Enter the branch you wish to deploy, select the pipeline you just created for the execute pipeline, and click `Add`

### Dokku Server Setup

Once you've booted your Dokku server, on the installation screen, copy and paste the public SSH key from the Wercker Project target. Then run the following steps:

```bash

# Create our express app
dokku apps:create express

# Create our volumes
mkdir -p /var/lib/dokku/data/express/cache
mkdir -p /var/lib/dokku/data/express/uploads

# Mount our volumes
dokku storage:mount express /var/lib/dokku/data/express/cache:/app/public/cache
dokku storage:mount express /var/lib/dokku/data/express/uploads:/app/public/uploads

# Restart our application on failure
dokku docker-options:add express deploy --restart=always

# Set our config values
dokku config:set express COOKIE_SECRET="$(< /dev/urandom tr -dc _A-Z-a-z-0-9 | head -c64)"
dokku config:set express GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_ID="[ga_id]"

# Setup out domains
dokku domains:add express example.com
dokku domains:add express www.example.com

# Setup any ssl certificates from string, tarball or stdin
dokku certs:add express certs.tar
```
